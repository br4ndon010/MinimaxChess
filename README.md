# MinimaxChess
Using python and taking advantage of Google Colabâ€™s cloud-based infrastructure, the game will pit two AI players against each other: one employing a simple random move strategy, and the other utilizing the more advanced Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to make strategic decisions.

# How to run
Using the [link to the project](https://colab.research.google.com/github/br4ndon010/MinimaxChess/blob/main/MinimaxChessAlgorithm.ipynb#scrollTo=-_UL8xbtSgKb), using Google Colab, will let anyone open and run the project after using a hosted runtime (connect) and going to Runtime -> Run All. The previous board, current board, and game results will appear below the "Game Setup and Main Loop" cell.
